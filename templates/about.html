    <b>About</b><br />
    This tool can convert an image to a gcode file for use with a laser engraver.

    <b>Commands per second</b><br />
    This tool generates gcode files with quite many commands per second.
    The number of commands per second that your system can handle strongly depends on the gCode sender.
    It can leave ugly marks on your piece when the laser head suddenly stalls because it waits
    for the next command and the buffer ran empty. This is also a possible cause for fire!
